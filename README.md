This project is an introduction to CSS/React and more based on skills developed in Kickstart Coding.

I will be creating a visual currency exchange graph that gets data from the exchangeratesapi.io API (JSON https://api.exchangeratesapi.io/latest).

The visualization will be done through bar charts
